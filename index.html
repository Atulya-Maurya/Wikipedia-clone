                <p>A white dwarf is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter, supported
                    against its own gravity only by electron degeneracy pressure. A white dwarf is very dense: in an
                    Earth sized volume, it contains a mass comparable to the Sun. What light it radiates is from its
                    residual heat. White dwarfs are thought to be the final evolutionary state of stars whose mass is
                    insufficient for them to become a neutron star or black hole. This includes more than 97% of the
                    stars in the Milky Way. After the hydrogen-fusing period of such a main-sequence star ends, it will
                    expand to a red giant and shed its outer layers, leaving behind a core which is the white dwarf.
                    This, very hot when it forms, cools as it radiates its energy until its material begins to
                    crystallize into a cold black dwarf. The oldest known white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of
                    a few thousand kelvins, which establishes an observational limit on the maximum possible age of the
                    universe. (Full article...)</p>
